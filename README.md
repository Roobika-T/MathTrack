			ADVANCED PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER


Abstract:
This project presents an advanced personal finance tracker that leverages machine learning and mathematical optimization algorithms to assist users in managing their expenses effectively. The system processes transaction data, provides insights through expense categorization, and forecasts future spending trends. It also allows for budget optimization using various algorithms, enabling users to make informed financial decisions.
The primary functionalities include:
Expense Summarization: Categorizes and summarizes debit transactions by their expense type.
Naive Bayes Classifier: Trains a Naive Bayes model to predict transaction categories based on text descriptions.
Newton-Raphson Method: Optimizes budget allocations by iterating on the difference between actual expenses and projected budget limits.
Gauss-Seidel Method: Approximates potential overshoot in budgets, iteratively improving the allocation of resources.
Power Method: Identifies the dominant spending category by computing the largest eigenvalue from the expense matrix.
ARIMA Time Series Forecasting: Predicts future monthly expenses based on historical data using the ARIMA model.
Cubic Spline Interpolation: Provides smooth forecasting of future expenses via cubic spline curve fitting.
These algorithms are wrapped in a user-friendly interface built using Gradio, which allows users to upload their transaction data, predict expense categories, and visualize future expense trends through interactive graphs. This tool offers a comprehensive approach to managing personal finances, combining forecasting, classification, and budgetary optimization in a single platform.
